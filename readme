Chicago Crime Prediction & Hotspot Analysis
Machine learning pipeline analyzing 8M+ crime records from Chicago (2001-present)
Built with: PySpark • XGBoost • Random Forest • DBSCAN • H3 Geospatial • Plotly Dash

📌 Project Summary
This project predicts crime categories and identifies hotspots across Chicago using 8 million historical crime records. The system uses distributed computing (PySpark) to handle massive datasets, machine learning for prediction, and geospatial analysis for hotspot detection.
Results: 50-60% accuracy predicting crime categories | 8-12 major hotspots identified | Interactive dashboard with real-time predictions

🎯 What This Project Does

Processes 8M+ records using PySpark (too large for Pandas)
Predicts crime categories using Random Forest and XGBoost models
Identifies crime hotspots using DBSCAN clustering and H3 hexagonal binning
Visualizes patterns through an interactive Dash dashboard

🔍 Where to Start (For Evaluators)
Week 1: Data Exploration (notebooks/week1.ipynb)

Loaded 8M records from Chicago Open Data Portal
Identified 200k+ rows with missing GPS coordinates
Created 10+ visualizations showing temporal patterns
Key Finding: Peak crime hours are 7 PM - 11 PM, summer has most crimes

Week 2: Feature Engineering (notebooks/week2.ipynb)

Built PySpark ETL pipeline (Pandas couldn't handle 8M rows)
Extracted temporal features: hour, day_of_week, month, season, is_weekend
Reduced 100+ IUCR crime codes → 12 interpretable categories
Key Decision: Category-level prediction instead of exact IUCR codes (solved class imbalance)

Week 3: Geospatial Analysis (notebooks/week3.ipynb)

Implemented DBSCAN clustering for crime density
Used H3 hexagonal binning for spatial aggregation
Generated Folium heatmaps showing hotspots
Key Result: Identified 8-12 major crime hotspot regions (Austin, Englewood, South Shore)

Week 4: Machine Learning (notebooks/week4.ipynb)

Trained Random Forest (55% accuracy) and XGBoost (60% accuracy)
Feature importance: Hour > District > Month > Location
Implemented top-2 prediction strategy for practical use
Key Achievement: 50-60% accuracy on 12-class problem (previously <20% on 100+ classes)

Dashboard (visualization/dashboard.py)

Real-time crime risk prediction interface
Interactive maps with H3 hexagons
Executive KPIs and trend visualizations


💡 Key Technical Challenges Solved
1. Massive Dataset Scale
Problem: 8M rows crashed Pandas
Solution: Migrated to PySpark for distributed processing
Impact: Reduced processing time from hours → 15 minutes
2. Severe Class Imbalance
Problem: 100+ crime types, many with <1000 occurrences
Solution: Grouped into 12 high-level categories (Violent, Property, Drug, etc.)
Impact: Model accuracy jumped from <20% → 60%
3. Missing GPS Coordinates
Problem: 200k+ rows had invalid lat/long
Solution: Filtered invalid coordinates, used district info as fallback
Impact: Clean geospatial analysis on 7.8M records
4. Slow Geospatial Clustering
Problem: DBSCAN on millions of points took hours
Solution: Aggregated by categories + strategic sampling
Impact: Generated hotspot maps in minutes instead of hours

🛠️ Technologies Used
Data Processing: PySpark, Pandas, NumPy
Machine Learning: Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Random Forest
